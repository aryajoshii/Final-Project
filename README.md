*inspiration!*

For my final project I am taking inspiration from retro game styles and space invaders, as well as this past student project.

*idea description!*

-I am going to make a space invaders style of game with the concept of cupid and love letters.
-The shooter at the bottom of the screen, that the user controls is cupid/an arrow which is shooting at a grid of envelopes.
-Controlled by the arrow keys on the user's keyboard (left and right arrow keys to move, up key to fire an arrow).
-You shoot at the envelopes and depending on which envelope you shoot, it reveals either a letter inside or a devil (like opposite of cupid), you then shoot again at the envelope if it reveals a letter and you get a point. If you shoot at a devil you lose points.

*aesthetics!*

-I want to stick to the retro game aesthetic and use pixel art, simple graphics. 
-I'm going to use a light colour scheme for my project with pastel shades, especially reds and pinks to fit with the theme. 
-I need to create my own images of envelopes, love letters and cupid. 
- I will have a separate clickable button on the homepage of the game to show instructions. I want to try animate this so it shows up as a love letter, to fit the theme of the game. 

*little things to think about*

-use early internet/email type fonts for the instructions
-do research into early internet chat rooms/dating sites and how they looked, maybe use the same type of terminology or font and include this in the readme file of the final project.
